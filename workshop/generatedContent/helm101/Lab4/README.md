# Lab 4. I like sharing

A key aspect of providing an application means sharing with others. Sharing can be direct counsumption (by users or in CI/CD pipelines) or as a dependency for other charts. If people can't find your app then they can't use it.

A means of sharing is a chart repository, which is a location where packaged charts can be stored and shared. As the chart repository only applies to Helm, we will just look at the usage and storage of Helm charts.

# Using charts from a public repository

Helm charts can be available on a remote repository or in a local environment/repository. The remote repositories can be public like [Bitnami Charts](https://github.com/bitnami/charts) or [IBM Helm Charts](https://github.com/IBM/charts), or hosted repositories like on Google Cloud Storage or GitHub. Refer to [Helm Chart Repository Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/) for more details.

In this part of the lab, we show you how to install the `guestbook` chart from the [Helm101 repo](https://ibm.github.io/helm101/).

1. Check the repositories configured on your system:

   ```$ helm repo list```
   
   The output should be similar to the following:
   
   ```console
   NAME  	URL                                             
   stable	https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
   local 	http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts                   
   ```
   
   Note: The Helm charts repository is installed by default with Helm. It is installed with the repositories `local` and `stable`. You can run the `local` repo using the [helm serve](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/helm/#helm-serve) command. The `stable` repo is located at `https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/`. The [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh) provides a centralized search for publicly available distributed charts. Using the hub you can identify the chart with its hosted repository and then add it to your local respoistory list. The [Helm chart repository](https://github.com/helm/charts) like Helm v2 is in "maintenance mode" and will be deprecated by November 13, 2020. See the [project status](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project) for more details.

2. Add `helm101` repo:

   ```$ helm repo add helm101 https://ibm.github.io/helm101/```
   
   Should generate an output as follows:
   
   ```"helm101" has been added to your repositories```
   
   You can also search your repositories for charts by running the following command, ```$ helm search helm101```:
   
   ```console
   NAME             	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION                                                 
   helm101/guestbook	0.1.0        	           	A Helm chart to deploy Guestbook three tier web application.
   ```
      
3. Install the chart

   As mentioned we are going to install the `guestbook` chart from the [Helm101 repo](https://ibm.github.io/helm101/). As the repo is installed in our local respoitory we can reference the chart using the `repo name/chart name`, in other words `helm101/guestbook`. This means we can install the chart like we did previously with the command:

   ```$ helm install helm101/guestbook --name guestbook-demo --namespace repo-demo```
   
   The output should be similar to the following:
   
   ```console
   NAME:   guestbook-demo
   LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Dec 13 07:36:18 2018
   NAMESPACE: repo-demo
   STATUS: DEPLOYED

   NOTES:
   Get the application URL by running these commands:
   export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace repo-demo -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services guestbook-demo-guestbook)
   export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath={.items[*].status.addresses[?\(@.type==\"ExternalIP\"\)].address})
   echo http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT```
   
# Conclusion

This lab provided you with a brief introduction to the Helm repositories to show how charts can be installed. The ability to share your chart means ease of use to both you and your consumers.
